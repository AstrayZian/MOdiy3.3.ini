Any custom maps you made or downloaded are to be placed in this directory. Custom maps need to have a .map extension. Extensions like .yrm, .mpr, .yro will not work with Mental Omega.

If you'd like to submit your custom map to be included in the official Mental Omega map pool, send them to mental.omega.apyr@gmail.com.
